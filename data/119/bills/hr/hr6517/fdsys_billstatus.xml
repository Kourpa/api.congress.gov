          <text>&lt;p&gt;This bill revises the procedures for appointing and removing the Librarian of Congress, the Director of the Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the Comptroller General by giving Congress the sole authority to appoint and remove these positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the bill requires the Librarian and the Director of GPO to each be selected by a bipartisan congressional commission (as established by the bill) and appointed by Congress through the adoption of a concurrent resolution. (Currently, these positions are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.) The Librarian and the Director of GPO may only be removed from office by an affirmative three-fifths vote in each chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the bill revises the appointment process for the Comptroller General. (Currently, the Comptroller General is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. A bipartisan congressional commission recommends at least three individuals to the President, who may ask the commission to recommend additional individuals.) This bill instead requires the bipartisan congressional commission to recommend one individual to Congress, and Congress may ask the commission to recommend additional individuals.&amp;nbsp;Congress must then appoint the selected individual through the adoption of a concurrent resolution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the bill revises the removal process for the Comptroller General. (Currently, the Comptroller General may be removed from office by impeachment or by joint resolution of Congress.) This bill changes the removal process so the individual may only be removed by impeachment or by concurrent (instead of joint) resolution of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;</text>
