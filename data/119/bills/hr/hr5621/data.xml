This bill expands certain health professional programs and Medicare covered services to include physical therapists.

Specifically, the bill expands the National Health Service Corps to include physical therapists and provides for the designation of specific health professional target areas for physical therapists under the program. The bill also expands covered services of rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers under Medicare to include physical therapy services.

The bill increases funds for FY2025 for the corps and requires a certain amount of funds to be used for student loan repayments for participating physical therapists in the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program.
