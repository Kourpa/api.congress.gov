        <cdata>
          <text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Big Beautiful Bill Act&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle A--Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As background, USDA created the&amp;nbsp;TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the section applies the work requirements for&amp;nbsp;ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the&amp;nbsp;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the section specifies that current&amp;nbsp;ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the&amp;nbsp;ABAWD waiver program's&amp;nbsp;allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an&amp;nbsp;ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the&amp;nbsp;ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use&amp;nbsp;SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household&amp;nbsp;internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state with a payment error rate that is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10% or greater must contribute 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) a citizen, or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions. Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section also extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031.

The declarations must include measurements of the greenhouse gases associated with all the relevant stages of production, use, and disposal of the construction materials and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 42113) This section repeals the methane emissions reduction program under which the EPA provides financial incentives to encourage the reporting of greenhouse gases, the monitoring of methane, and the reduction of methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 42114) This section repeals the EPA’s program that awards grants to states, air pollution control agencies, municipalities, and Indian tribes for developing and implementing plans to reduce greenhouse gas air pollution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 42115) This section rescinds certain funding relating to the EPA providing efficient, accurate, and timely reviews, including&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;developing efficient, accurate, and timely reviews for permitting and approval processes through the hiring and training of personnel;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;developing programmatic documents;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;procuring technical or scientific services for reviews;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;developing environmental data or information systems;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaging stakeholders;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;purchasing new equipment for environmental analysis; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;developing geographic information systems and other analysis tools, techniques, and guidance to improve agency transparency, accountability, and public engagement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 42116) This section repeals a program under which the EPA identifies and labels construction materials and products that have substantially lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions associated with all the relevant stages of production, use, and disposal of the materials and products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 42117) This section repeals funding to the EPA for environmental and climate justice block grants that benefit disadvantaged communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2--Repeal of EPA Rule Relating to Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part nullifies the final rule issued by the EPA titled Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles and published on April 18, 2024. The rule established and modified requirements for certain light-duty or medium-duty vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, and sports utility vehicles that are under a certain weight), including requirements related to (1) emission standards, such as a greenhouse gas emission standard; (2) the durability of batteries for certain electric and hybrid vehicles; and (3) measuring fuel economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3--Repeal of&amp;nbsp;NHTSA Rule Relating to CAFE Standards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part nullifies the final rule issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration titled Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond and published on June 24, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle C--Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1--Spectrum Auctions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 43101) This section renews the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction licenses for the use of radio frequency spectrum and requires certain frequencies to be reallocated and auctioned on an exclusive, licensed basis for fixed and mobile broadband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this section&amp;nbsp;reauthorizes the FCC’s use of competitive bidding (i.e., auctions) to grant licenses for the use of specific frequencies through September 30, 2034. (The FCC’s auction authority must be renewed by Congress periodically. It expired on March 9, 2023, and has not been renewed.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, within two years of this title’s enactment, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) must identify at least 600 megahertz of spectrum at frequencies between 1.3 and 10 gigahertz for reallocation to nonfederal use on an exclusive, licensed basis. (Certain frequencies used primarily by the Department of Defense and unlicensed devices, including Wi-Fi, are excluded from auction eligibility.) To the extent that the identified spectrum is currently assigned to federal users, the NTIA must withdraw or modify such assignments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC must conduct one or more auctions of the identified spectrum for use on an exclusive, &amp;nbsp;licensed basis for mobile broadband, fixed broadband, or a combination thereof. The FCC must complete auctioning at least 200 megahertz of the identified spectrum within three years of this title’s enactment, and must complete auctioning any remaining spectrum within six years of enactment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2--Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology Modernization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 43201) This section prohibits states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence (AI) models, AI systems, or automated decision systems for 10 years. This prohibition does not apply to any state law or regulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the primary purpose and effect of which is to remove legal impediments to, facilitate the deployment or operation of, or consolidate administrative procedures in a manner that facilitates the adoption of AI models, AI systems, or automated decision systems;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;that does not impose substantive design, performance, data-handling, documentation, civil liability, taxation, fee, or other requirements on AI models, AI systems, or automated decision systems, unless such requirements are imposed under federal law or are generally applicable to other models and systems that perform similar functions; or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;that imposes only fees and bonds that are reasonable and cost-based and treat other models and systems that perform similar functions in the same manner as AI models, AI systems, and automated decision systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This section also provides specified funds to the Department of Commerce to modernize and secure federal information technology systems through the replacement of some existing systems and the deployment of commercial AI and automation technologies. Specifically, Commerce must use funds appropriated under this section to (1) replace or modernize legacy business systems with commercial AI and automated decision systems; (2) facilitate the adoption of AI models that increase efficiency and service delivery; and (3) improve the&amp;nbsp;cybersecurity of federal information technology systems through modernized architecture, automated threat detection, and integrated AI solutions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this section, AI is defined as a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. An AI model is a software component of an information system that implements AI technology and uses computational, statistical, or machine-learning techniques to produce outputs from a defined set of inputs. An AI system is any data system, software, hardware, application, tool, or utility that operates in whole or in part using AI. An automated decision system is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data&amp;nbsp;analytics, or AI that issues a simplified output (e.g., a score, classification, or recommendation) to materially influence or replace human decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle D--Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 1--Medicaid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpart A--Reducing Fraud and Improving Enrollment Processes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44103) This section requires the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish a centralized system for states to check whether enrollees are simultaneously enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in multiple states.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning no later than 2027, states must regularly obtain the addresses of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees from specified authorized sources. Beginning no later than FY2030, states must report on at least a monthly basis the Social Security numbers of enrollees to the&amp;nbsp;CMS' newly established system. The CMS must notify states on at least a monthly basis of individuals who are enrolled in multiple states so that states may take appropriate action.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section provides funds for FY2026 and FY2029 for the&amp;nbsp;CMS to establish and maintain the new system, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44104) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, the Social Security Administration's Death Master File on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether Medicaid enrollees are deceased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44105) This section requires state Medicaid programs to check, beginning in 2028, as part of the provider enrollment and&amp;nbsp;reenrollment process, whether providers were terminated from participating in the Medicare program, any other state Medicaid program, or CHIP using certain databases (e.g., the Data EXchange system). The section requires states to continue to check these databases on at least a monthly basis after providers are enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44106) This section provides statutory authority for the requirement that state Medicaid programs check, as part of the provider enrollment and&amp;nbsp;reenrollment process, whether providers are deceased through the Social Security Administration's Death Master File. Beginning in 2028, the section requires states to continue to check this database on at least a quarterly basis after providers are enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44108) This section requires state Medicaid programs to&amp;nbsp;redetermine every six months, beginning in FY2028, the eligibility of individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. (The act allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to all adults under the age of 65 with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, including able-bodied adults without dependent children.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44111) This section reduces by 10%, beginning in FY2028, the enhanced federal matching rate for the Medicaid expansion population in states that provide comprehensive health benefits or financial assistance for purchasing health benefits to individuals who are not lawfully residing in the United States, regardless of the source of the benefits or financial assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpart B--Preventing Wasteful Spending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44123) This section provides funds through FY2033 for the&amp;nbsp;CMS to survey retail and non-retail pharmacies (e.g., mail-order pharmacies) to determine average prices of covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid. Pharmacies that fail to participate in the surveys are subject to civil penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section additionally provides funds for FY2026 for the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) to study the results of the survey and report accordingly to Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44124) This section requires pass-through pricing models, and prohibits spread-pricing, for payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) under Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44125) This section prohibits federal payment under Medicaid or CHIP for specified gender transition procedures for individuals under the age of 18. The section defines these procedures to mean those that are intended to change the body of an individual to no longer correspond to the individual's biological sex (male or female), including specified surgeries, implants, and medications (e.g., hormones).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section excludes procedures that are provided to an individual under the age of 18 with the consent of a parent or legal guardian and that are intended to (1) rectify early puberty, genetic disorders, or chromosomal abnormalities; (2) reverse prior gender transition procedures; or (3) prevent imminent death or impairment of a major bodily function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44126) This section prohibits federal Medicaid payment for 10 years to nonprofit health care providers that serve predominantly low-income, medically&amp;nbsp;underserved individuals (i.e., essential community providers) if the provider (1) primarily furnishes family planning services, reproductive health, and related care; (2) offers abortions in cases other than that of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions for the woman; and (3) in FY2024, received federal and state Medicaid payments totaling more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpart C--Stopping Abusive Financing Practices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44131) This section requires states that had not chosen to expand Medicaid pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prior to March 11, 2021, to do so by January 1, 2026, in order to receive the corresponding enhanced federal matching rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44132) This section generally precludes states from instituting new or otherwise increasing Medicaid provider taxes. Specifically, the section precludes the revenue from any Medicaid provider tax that is newly imposed or increased by a state from qualifying for federal matching payments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44133) This section provides funds through FY2033 for the&amp;nbsp;CMS to revise regulations so as to limit state-directed payments for inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or qualified practitioner services at an academic medical center under Medicaid managed care contracts to the payment rate for services under Medicare, rather than the average commercial rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpart D--Increasing Personal Accountability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44141) This section requires, beginning in 2029, individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population to engage in community service, work, or other activities in order to qualify for Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the section requires these individuals to, on a monthly basis, (1) work at least 80 hours, (2) complete at least 80 hours of community service, (3) participate in a work program for at least 80 hours, (4) be enrolled at least half-time in an educational program, or (5) engage in any combination thereof for a total of at least 80 hours. Individuals may also qualify if they have a monthly income that is at least as much as the equivalent of minimum wage multiplied by 80 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are applying for Medicaid must demonstrate compliance with these requirements for one month or more (as determined by the state) consecutively and immediately prior to filing an application; individuals who are already enrolled in Medicaid must demonstrate compliance for one month or more (as determined by the state), whether or not consecutive, during the period between the individual’s last eligibility determination and the next scheduled eligibility determination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States must verify an individual’s compliance upon a determination or redetermination of eligibility but may also choose to verify compliance more frequently. States may not waive the new requirements. However, states may choose to provide an exception for individuals experiencing short-term hardships (e.g., hospitalization).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section excludes certain individuals from these requirements, including those with serious medical conditions or dependent children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section provides funds for FY2026 for states and the&amp;nbsp;CMS to implement these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44142) This section requires, beginning in FY2029, states to institute cost-sharing requirements for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid as part of the Medicaid expansion population and whose family income exceeds the federal poverty line. Cost sharing may not exceed $35 for an item or service; total cost sharing for all individuals in a family may not exceed 5% of the family’s income.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirements do not apply to services for which cost sharing is already prohibited (e.g., emergency services). States may allow providers to condition the provision of services upon the payment of any required cost sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 2--Affordable Care Act&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44201) This section modifies enrollment, coverage, and other aspects of health insurance exchanges beginning in 2026, including prohibiting the mandate of special enrollment periods based on income, requiring verification of income and other eligibility requirements prior to certain enrollments, and prohibiting coverage of gender transition procedures as an essential health benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part 3--Improving Americans’ Access to Care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44301) This section modifies certain provisions under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program with respect to orphan drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program requires the&amp;nbsp;CMS to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs under Medicare beginning in 2026. Among other requirements, drugs must have had market approval for at least 7 years (for drug products) or 11 years (for biologics) to qualify for negotiation. The program does not apply to orphan drugs that are approved to treat only one rare disease or condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill modifies these provisions so as to exclude any period in which a drug was an orphan drug from market approval calculations. It also excludes orphan drugs that are approved to treat more than one rare disease or condition from the program. The changes take effect in 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44302) This section requires states to establish a process through which qualifying out-of-state providers may temporarily treat children under Medicaid and CHIP without undergoing additional screening requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, states must establish a process through which qualifying out-of-state providers may enroll for five years as participating providers to treat individuals under the age of 21 without undergoing additional screening requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A qualifying out-of-state provider (1) must not have been excluded or terminated from participating in a federal health care program or state Medicaid program; and (2) must have been successfully enrolled in Medicare or a state Medicaid program based on a determination that the provider posed a limited risk of fraud, waste, or abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section’s changes take effect four years after enactment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 44305) This section prohibits&amp;nbsp;PBMs under the Medicare prescription drug benefit or Medicare Advantage from receiving any income for their services other than bona fide service fees. It also establishes reporting requirements for PBMs relating to the prices of prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, beginning in 2028,&amp;nbsp;PBMs may not receive any income other than flat, bona fide service fees. PBMs must turn over any excess amounts they receive to prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsors; PDP sponsors must turn over these amounts to the CMS. In addition, PBMs must report to PDP sponsors and to the CMS an itemized list of prescription drugs that were dispensed during the previous year and related data about costs, claims, affiliated pharmacies, and other specified information. The section provides funds for FY2025 for the CMS and the OIG to implement these requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE V--COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 50001) This section rescinds&amp;nbsp;unobligated funds from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Such a major rule may only take effect if Congress approves of the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the section establishes a procedure for disapproving rules that increased revenues submitted during the final year of a president’s term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, agencies must annually submit for review rules currently in effect. Any rule not approved by Congress at the end of this review period is discontinued.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section provides funding to the Office of Management and Budget and to the Government Accountability Office to carry out this section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle&amp;nbsp;C--Other Matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 70300) This section prohibits the federal government from entering into or enforcing a settlement agreement on behalf of the United States that provides for a payment to any person or entity other than the United States. The section provides exceptions to allow payments that (1) remedy actual harm (including to the environment) caused by the party making the payment, or (2) constitute a payment for services rendered in connection with the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office of inspector general for each agency must report annually on any settlement agreements that violate the section’s requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 70301) This section expands the definition of solicitation of orders to include business activities that serve an independently valuable business function apart from the solicitation of orders for purposes of the limitation on a state’s authority to impose a net income tax on an out-of-state seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under current law, a state is prohibited from imposing a net income tax on income derived from within the state from interstate commerce if the only business activity within the state is the solicitation of orders for the sale of tangible personal property, provided that the orders are approved (or rejected) and filled by shipment or delivery from outside of the state. Further, the Supreme Court has held that the term solicitation of orders includes (1) activities that are strictly essential to making requests for purchases, and (2) ancillary activities that serve no independent business function apart from their connection to requests for purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this section, the definition of solicitation of orders is expanded to include business activities that facilitate the solicitation of orders even if such business activities serve an independently valuable business function apart from the solicitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 70302) This section limits the ability of U.S. courts to enforce a citation for contempt for failure to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order. Specifically, if no security was given when the injection or order was issued, the citation of contempt may not be enforced using appropriated funds. This limitation applies to injunctions or orders issued before, on, or after the date of enactment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TITLE VIII--COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtitle A--Energy and Mineral Resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part I--Oil and Gas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 80101) This section establishes requirements about leasing onshore federal land for oil and natural gas development, including by directing the Department of the Interior to immediately resume onshore quarterly lease sales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sec. 80102) This section modifies noncompetitive leasing procedures under the Mineral Leasing Act.

In conducting this audit, OPM must review marriage certificates, birth certificates, and other appropriate documents to determine eligibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;OPM must develop a process to disenroll or remove an individual who is not eligible to participate in the FEHB program and notify the OPM inspector general of such disenrollment or removal. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section allows for some Employees Health Benefits Fund amounts to be available to&amp;nbsp;OPM annually starting in FY2026 to develop, maintain, and conduct ongoing eligibility verification and oversight and oversight of the FEHB enrollment and eligibility systems.
